# Vulnerability-Assessment

Using Nessus to complete a vulnerability scan on Metasploitable, Windows 10, and Ubuntu helps identify security weaknesses in operating systems. Nessus is a robust vulnerability assessment tool that scans for potential vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and missing patches. A basic network scan was conducted to complete this project; however, different types of scans can be performed, such as advanced scans, malware scans, web application scans, and even PCI DSS framework scans.
